# Use 3rd party analytics integration

Date: 2022-11-06

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Analytics should provide functionality that will track analytics of website activity and connections on
web and mobile applications. Analytics should take application data and aggregate it with others
publicly available data to create reports that will show the impact of the application in the community.

## Decision
Outsource the handling of analytical data to third parties.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Without coding skills it is possible to rabidly develop complex powerful and cost effective data pipelines 
- Support from the contracted party

### Negative:
- Data security and encryption standards are questionable
